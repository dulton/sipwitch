.SH NAME
sipw \- sipwitch service daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sipw
.RB [ options ]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a service daemon for the SIP protocol.  This daemon enables sip
devices and softphone applications to register as well as to route messages
for the SIP protocol between arbitrary endpoints, both locally and remote
over the Internet using DNS to resolve destination uri's.  As a telephone
system, \fBsipw\fR offers call redirection, speed dials, call forwarding,
sms style instant messaging, and the ability to ring multiple user agents
tied together under a common user id.
.PP
The \fBsipw\fR daemon is also being used as a mediator for desktop telephony.
For this purpose, sip users become the same as normal login accounts which
happen to be in a specific group of sipusers, and \fBsipw\fR will assume a
role for VoIP services similar to what gstreamer does for media.
.SH OPTIONS
Normally the \fBsipw\fR daemon is started from an init script or upstart
rather than manually, and hence only those options setable in the
.I /etc/default/sipwitch
config file can be set.  However, the \fBsipw\fR daemon can be manually
started, both in the foreground for testing, and in the background.  If
this is done, a number of options may be passed to it directly as documented.
.TP
.B \-\-background
Execute the \fBsipw\fR daemon detached in the background (default).
.TP
.BI \-\-concurrency= level
Set the pthread concurrency level for the \fBsipw\fR process.
.TP
.BI \-\-debug= level
Specify debug logging \fIlevel\fR (0-9).  When run in foreground debug
messages are shown on the console.  When in background they are saved in
the sipwitch log file.
.TP
.B \-\-foreground
Execute the \fBsipw\fR daemon in the foreground, with output shown on stdout
or stderr.
.TP
.B \-\-gdb
Execute the \fBsipw\fR daemon under control of gdb for full debugging.
.TP
.BI \-\-group= id
Specify the group \fIid\fR that the \fBsipw\fR daemon will execute as for
receiving control messages or access to daemon managed shared memory.
.TP
.B \-\-memcheck
Execute the \fBsipw\fR daemon under valgrind to validate basic memory management.
.TP
.B \-\-memleak
Execute the \fBsipw\fR daemon under valgrind for full memory leak detection.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-localusers
Disable use of local (system) user accounts entirely.
.TP
.BI \-\-plugins= names
Load only these specified plugins from /var/lib/sipwitch.
.TP
.BI \-\-priority= level
Execute the \fBsipw\fR daemon under the realtime (fifo) schedule, and specify
a realtime process priority \fIlevel\fR (1-9).
.TP
.B \-\-restarable
The \fBsipw\fR daemon will automatically restart if it exits or crashes other
than from a manually specified reason.  This is often used on BSD systems
when \fBsipw\fR is started from an rc file.
.TP
.B \-\-trace
Logs sip messages the \fBsipw\fR daemon sends and receives.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the currently installed version of sipwitch to standard output.
