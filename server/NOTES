TRANSFER & FORWARD REFERS!!!!!

* Forwarding to call/hunt groups done as local refer/new call!
	- re-evaluates dialing plan....
	- groups do not use "forwarding" same way

* destination leg refer after connect:
	- always done by sending refer to originating leg.  Required so that
      sdp negotiation can be re-done for peer-to-peer, ISSUE FOR PROVIDER

* NATTING???
	refelector?  Maybe just allow endpoint to control it's own direct rtp
	with forwarding??



PROVIDERS:

* PROVIDER SUPPORT MAY FORCE SINGLE SDP ENCODING SO CAN REDIRECT RTP WHEN
 REFER OPERATIONS HAPPEN!!!


CALL FORWARDING:
	All outside forward (offsite) DONE BY REFER!!!!
	All internal forward either to registry targets OR LOCAL REFER!!!!

SIPWITCH: B2BUA/CALL SERVER - NO PROVIDER SUPPORT????!!!
NEEDED:	  TROLL FOR SERVICE PROVIDER GATEWAYING!!!
		(HANDLES LOCAL END REFERS FROM SIPWITCH CLEANER!!)
