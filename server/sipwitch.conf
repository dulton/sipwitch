	 extension 200.  This is useful when sharing a common set of
	 user provisioning records over multiple servers which are routed
	 and segmented.  Hence if I want to call an extension outside of
	 the range of the server I register with, I initially authenticate
	 since this server has the common provisioning, but I then am referred
	 to the actual target server where the destination user is registered.
