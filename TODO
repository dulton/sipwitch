Only the most basic call processing for ring/busy/answer states of direct
targetted extensions is supported initially.  Distributed calling by multi-
registration on a single id is supported.

While call forwarding information is processed from config, and diversion
headers in invites are coded, it is not acted upon in any way.  In theory, we
will forward to registry entries, and other types of references to call groups
and/or external entries will be done by refer.
