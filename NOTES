About locking:

Inside the SIPWitch server we use shared conditional locks.  Some key
assumptions are made and must never be violated:

Methods that assert modify locks must never aquire additional shared locks;
	all their arguments have all data needed to complete the operation
	
Methods that assert modify locks always either commit or share before they 
	return.  No function will return with a modify lock still held.

Lookup methods will return with a shared lock held if they are successful.
	A matching release function will be used to clear the lock when the
	object is no longer needed.
