.SH NAME
sipquery \- register and report sip contact details
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sipquery
.RB [ options ]
.I userid[@server[:port]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a tool that uses the registration process to query the sip contact
uri for a registered user agent.  This may even be considered a demonstration
of a security flaw in the standard SIP server model.  Basically, an
un-authenticated registration request is sent to the server, and the contact
uri is read to standard out from the server reply message.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-\-forward= address
Sets the "public appearing" IP address for testing behind NAT.
.TP
.BI \-\-port= number
Sets the sip port number, in case the default port (5060) is in use already.
.TP
.BI \-\-proxy= host
Use a specified outbound proxy uri to get to the server being queried.
.TP
.BI \-\-server= host
Specify server uri to query unless offered as part of userid.
.TP
.BI \-\-timeout= seconds
Time to wait for query response.
