.SH NAME
sipwitch.cgi \- web services for sipwitch
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sipwitch.cgi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is not meant as a user executed application.  Instead, \fBsipwitch.cgi\fR
will be symlinked to or typically executed from a web server's cgi-bin
directory.  This utility offers a remote web-driven XMLRPC interface for
managing a locally resident \fBsipw\fR daemon, including the ability to collect
statistics and call information, and to perform control operations.  This is
meant to support creation of remote management applications for sipwitch,
especially when \fBsipw\fR might be executed on a dedicated router.
