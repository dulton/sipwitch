.SH NAME
sipwitch \- Script control and manage GNU sipwitch server.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sipwitch \fIcommand\fR \fI[arguments...]\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The sipwitch command allows one to interact with a running sipwitch daemon
instance on the current machine.  This can be used to create management shell
scripts or to perform basic service operations, using the sipwitch fifo control
interface.  Normally this command would be used only by root or someone in an
admin group that the sipwitch deamon is running under.  If the sipwitch deamon
is started by an ordinary user, the command can be used by the same user to
control that daemon instance.
